# Ansible Role: uberspace-web-backend

This is part of the uberspace roles collection.

This is meant to be used on your [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/).

Please be aware, that I'm neither part of the Uberspace team, nor am I associated to them other than having some Uberspaces myself.
This project was created, because I wanted to use the roles for myself and thought they were okay-ish enough to share them.

## What is this (from the uberspace manual)

Using web backends you can connect your applications directly to our frontend to make them accessible from the outside. Traffic is proxied transparently to your application: WebSockets just work and your Host header is set correctly. If you have prior experience with RewriteRule proxies, are also much faster.

You can find the documentation of the replaced tool `uberspace web backend` in the Uberspace Manual [here](https://manual.uberspace.de/web-backends.html).
